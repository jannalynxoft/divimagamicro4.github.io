Our primary goal is to care for, educate, and provide life opportunities to those communities and their disadvantaged women whom are identified as Small and Medium Scale entrepreneurs, planters, cultivators, daily wage earners and potential leaders and entrepreneurs whose growth is just hindered due to lack of financial assets and adequate support for development.

At present we closely work with an approximate number of 1500 customers pertaining to be Small and Medium Scale entrepreneurs, planters, cultivators, farmers, tailors, caterers, party planners, event goods facilitators, etc.
